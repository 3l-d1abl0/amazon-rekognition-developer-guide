# Detecting Objects and Scenes<a name="labels"></a>

This section provides information for detecting labels in images and videos with Rekognition Image and Rekognition Video\. 

 A label or a tag is an object, scene, or concept found in an image or video based on its contents\. For example, a photo of people on a tropical beach may contain labels such as Person, Water, Sand, Palm Tree, and Swimwear \(objects\), Beach \(scene\), and Outdoors \(concept\)\. Rekognition Video can also detect activities such as a person skiing or riding a bike\. Rekognition Image does not detect activities in images\.

For example, in the following image, Rekognition Image is able to detect the presence of a person, a skateboard, parked cars and other information\. Rekognition Video and Rekognition Image also provide a percentage score for how much confidence Amazon Rekognition has in the accuracy of each detected label\.
