# Recommendations for Camera Set\-Up \(Stored and Streaming video\)<a name="recommendations-camera-stored-streaming-video"></a>

The following recommendations are in addition to [Recommendations for Camera Set\-Up \(Image and Video\)](recommendations-camera-image-video.md)\.
+ The codec should be h\.264 encoded\.
+ The recommended frame rate is 30 fps\. \(It should not be less than 5 fps\.\)
+ The recommended encoder bitrate is 3 Mbps\. \(It should not be less than 1\.5 Mbps\.\)
+ Frame Rate vs\. Frame Resolution â€” If the encoder bitrate is a constraint, we recommend favoring a higher frame resolution over a higher frame rate for better face search results\. This will ensure Amazon Rekognition gets the best quality frame within the allocated bit rate\. However, there is a downside to this: due to the low frame rate, the camera will miss fast motion in a scene\. It is important to understand the trade\-offs between these two parameters for a given set\-up\. For example, if the maximum possible bit rate is 1\.5 MBPS, a camera can capture 1080p at 5 fps or 720p at 15 fps\. The choice between the two is application dependent, as long as the recommended face resolution of 50x50 pixels is met\.
