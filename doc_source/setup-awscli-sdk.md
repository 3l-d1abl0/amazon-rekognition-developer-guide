# Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs<a name="setup-awscli-sdk"></a>

The following steps show you how to install the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) and AWS SDKs that the examples in this documentation use\. There are a number of different ways to authenticate AWS SDK calls\. The examples in this guide assume that you're using a default credentials profile for calling AWS CLI commands and AWS SDK API operations\.

For a list of available AWS Regions, see [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

Follow the steps to download and configure the AWS SDKs\.
