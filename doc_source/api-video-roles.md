# Configuring Amazon Rekognition Video<a name="api-video-roles"></a>

To use the Amazon Rekognition Video API with stored videos, you have to configure the IAM user and an IAM service role to access your Amazon SNS topics\. The following procedures show you how to configure Amazon Rekognition Video for use with the examples in this section\. To do this, you: 
+ Create an IAM user, or give an IAM user access to the Amazon Rekognition Video API\. In this example, full access to the entire Amazon Rekognition API is given, but you can restrict access as required\.
+ Install and configure the AWS SDK that you want to use\. 
+ Create an IAM service role that allows Amazon Rekognition Video to publish the completion status of an analysis request to an Amazon SNS topic\. 
+ Give the example code access to the Amazon SQS queue that the Amazon SNS message is retrieved from\. Full access is required because the example code deletes the message from the queue\.
+ Give the example code read access to the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the stored video file\. 

**Note**  
The examples in this section create a new Amazon SNS topic by using the instructions that give Amazon Rekognition Video access to multiple topics\. If you want to use an existing Amazon SNS topic, use [Giving Access to an Existing Amazon SNS Topic](#api-video-roles-single-topics) for step 3\.

**To configure Amazon Rekognition Video**

1. Set up an AWS account to access Amazon Rekognition Video\. For more information, see [Step 1: Set Up an AWS Account and Create an IAM User](setting-up.md)\.

   Ensure the user has at least the following permissions:
   + AmazonSQSFullAccess
   + AmazonRekognitionFullAccess
   + AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

1. Install and configure the required AWS SDK\. For more information, see [Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs](setup-awscli-sdk.md)\. 

1. Create an IAM service role to give Amazon Rekognition Video access to your Amazon SNS topics\. Note the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the service role\. For more information, see [Giving Access to Multiple Amazon SNS Topics](#api-video-roles-all-topics)\.

1. [ Add the following inline policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#embed-inline-policy-console) to the IAM user that you created in step 1: 

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "MySid",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "iam:PassRole",
               "Resource": "arn:Service role ARN from step 3"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Give the inline policy a name of your choosing\.

1. You can now run the examples in [Analyzing a Video Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket with Java or Python \(SDK\)](video-analyzing-with-sqs.md) and [Analyzing a Video with the AWS Command Line Interface](video-cli-commands.md)\.

## Giving Access to Multiple Amazon SNS Topics<a name="api-video-roles-all-topics"></a>

You use an IAM service role to give Amazon Rekognition Video access to Amazon SNS topics that you create\. IAM provides the *Rekognition* use case for creating an Amazon Rekognition Video service role\.

You can give Amazon Rekognition Video access to multiple Amazon SNS topics by using the `AmazonRekognitionServiceRole` permissions policy and prepending the topic names with *AmazonRekognition*â€”for example, `AmazonRekognitionMyTopicName`\. 

**To give Amazon Rekognition Video access to multiple Amazon SNS topics**

1. [Create an IAM service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console)\. Use the following information to create the IAM service role:

   1. Choose **Rekognition** for the service name\.

   1. Choose **Rekognition** for the service role use case\. You should see the **AmazonRekognitionServiceRole** permissions policy listed\. **AmazonRekognitionServiceRole** gives Amazon Rekognition Video access to Amazon SNS topics that are prefixed with *AmazonRekognition*\.

   1. Give the service role a name of your choosing\.

1. Note the ARN of the service role\. You need it to start video analysis operations\.

## Giving Access to an Existing Amazon SNS Topic<a name="api-video-roles-single-topics"></a>

You can create a permissions policy that allows Amazon Rekognition Video access to an existing Amazon SNS topic\.

**To give Amazon Rekognition Video access to an existing Amazon SNS topic**

1. [ Create a new permissions policy with the IAM JSON policy editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html#access_policies_create-json-editor), and use the following policy\. Replace `topicarn` with the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the desired Amazon SNS topic\.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "sns:Publish"
               ],
               "Resource": "topicarn"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. [Create an IAM service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console), or update an existing IAM service role\. Use the following information to create the IAM service role:

   1. Choose **Rekognition** for the service name\.

   1. Choose **Rekognition** for the service role use case\.

   1. Attach the permissions policy you created in step 1\.

1. Note the ARN of the service role\. You need it to start video analysis operations\.
